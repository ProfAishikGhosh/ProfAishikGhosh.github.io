- **Theoretical physics**: Coming up with theories and calculating their predictions is hard. What if you could teach an AI agent to work that out for you? We design symbolic AI algorithms that can arrive at novel solutions to hard computational problems in theoretical physics. For instance, to design new phenomenological models[^1], complete cumbersome calculations or find novel solutions to long-established problems. We are in the process of significantly expanding this research direction.
- **Statistical methods in particle physics and astrophysics**: Raw data from experiments or telescopes are complex and high-dimensional. Compressing the data leads to the loss of crucial information, while slow number crunching leads to missed opportunities, for instance, to see a supernova. Can we rapidly analyse these data, without having to make simplifying assumptions? We design statistical inference techniques that can transform Higgs physics at the Large Hadron Collider, neutrino physics at Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, and neutron star astrophysics from telescopes. Learn more about our work in [particle physics](/ParticlePhysics/) and [astrophysics](/Astrophysics/).
- **Accelerating discovery**: Designing mathematical models that describe Nature requires simulating their predictions and comparing these to data. Physicists can come up with way more ideas than they can test! We develop fast, accurate, and generalizable machine learning methods to simulate astrophysical and particle physics phenomena. We also develop machine learning tools that could help design future experiments.

Our group engages in cross-disciplinary collaborations and welcomes students from across academic backgrounds. Most projects in the group involve computational tools and AI/ML, so students with strong skills or interest in these areas will find a natural fit here. We are also interested in collaborations in the history of science and scientific outreach. 
The group welcomes students who have taken career breaks or followed non-traditional career paths and students from across socio-economic backgrounds and genders.
