- **Theoretical physics**: We design neuro-symbolic algorithms that can perform symbolic manipulation and arrive at novel solutions to hard computational problems in theoretical physics. For instance, to design [new phenomenological models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08080). We are in the process of significantly expanding this research direction over the coming years.
- **Statistical methods in particle physics and astrophysics**: Raw data from experiments or telescopes are complex and high dimensional. We design statistical inference techniques to rapidly analyse these data without having to make simplifying assumptions that have been at the core of traditional statistical inference paradigms. These concepts can be adapted to Higgs physics at the Large Hadron Collider, neutrino physics at Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment and neutron star astrophysics. See more about our [particle physics](/ParticlePhysics/) and [astrophysics](/Astrophysics/) work.
- **Accelerating Discovery**: Designing mathematical models that describe Nature requires simulating their predictions and comparing them to data. We develop fast, accurate, and generalizable machine learning methods to simulate astrophysical and particle physics phenomena. The group is also involved in designing the next generation of experiments by leveraging machine learning tools.

We engage in cross-disciplinary collaborations and welcome students from across academic backgrounds. Most projects in the group involve computational tools and AI/ML, so students with strong skills or interest in these areas will find a natural fit here. We are also interested in collaborations in the history of science and scientific outreach. 
The group wlcomes students who have taken career breaks or followed non-traditional career paths and students from across socio-economic backgrounds and genders.
